[p5.sound](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) by [Jason Sigal](http://jasonsigal.cc) brings the Processing approach to Web Audio. This add-on for p5.js shares syntax with Wilm Thoben's Processing Sound library. Its functionality includes audio input, playback, manipulation, effects, recording, sequencing, analysis and synthesis. The source code is on [github](https://github.com/therewasaguy/p5.sound), with [interactive documentation](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) and [learning examples](http://p5js.org/learn) on p5js.org. This summer, Jason also ported the [Table](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/src/objects/p5.Table.js) / [TableRow](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/src/objects/p5.TableRow.js) classes, and wrote methods for file [input](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/src/input/files.js) / [output](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js/blob/master/src/output/files.js).
